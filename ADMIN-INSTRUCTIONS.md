# Work IQ - Tenant Administrator Enablement Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for Microsoft 365 tenant administrators to enable Work IQ for their organization.

---

## Quick Start (For Admins with Copilot Licenses)

If your organization already has Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses, you can enable Work IQ in minutes:

1. Open this URL in your browser (replace `{your-tenant-id}` with your tenant ID or domain):

```text
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your-tenant-id}/adminconsent?client_id=ba081686-5d24-4bc6-a0d6-d034ecffed87
```

2. Sign in with your admin account
3. Click **Accept** to grant consent for your entire organization

That's it! Users with Copilot licenses can now install and use Work IQ. See the [Work IQ README](https://github.com/microsoft/work-iq-mcp/blob/main/README.md) for end-user installation instructions.

## Overview

Work IQ uses the Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat API as its backend. This API requires specific delegated permissions that need administrative consent before users in your organization can use Work IQ.

### Required API Permissions

Work IQ requires the following delegated permissions (all are required):

| Permission                           | Description                                  |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Sites.Read.All`                     | Read items in all site collections           |
| `Mail.Read`                          | Read user mail                               |
| `People.Read.All`                    | Read all users' relevant people lists        |
| `OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All`   | Read all transcripts of online meetings      |
| `Chat.Read`                          | Read user chat messages                      |
| `ChannelMessage.Read.All`            | Read all channel messages                    |
| `ExternalItem.Read.All`              | Read external items                          |

2. Search for **Microsoft 365 Copilot**
3. Complete the purchase process

> **Note:** For Education tenants, look for licenses under **Microsoft 365 A3 Extra Features for faculty** or **Microsoft 365 A5 Extra Features for faculty**.

## Step 2: Configure Microsoft 365 Copilot in Your Tenant

Before users can use Work IQ, ensure Microsoft 365 Copilot is properly configured in your tenant.

### 2.1 Enable Required Security Measures

1. **Enable Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Go to **Microsoft Entra admin center** > **Protection** > **Conditional Access**
   - Ensure MFA is enabled for all users

2. **Enable Audit Logging**
   - Go to **Microsoft Purview portal** (https://purview.microsoft.com)
   - Enable unified audit logging
   - Configure appropriate retention policies

### 2.2 Configure Update Channels

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Org settings**
2. Navigate to **Services** > **Office installation options**
3. Ensure your organization uses a supported update channel:
   - **Current Channel** (Recommended)
   - **Monthly Enterprise Channel**
   - **Current Channel (Preview)**

> **Important:** Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel is NOT supported for Copilot.

### 2.3 Configure Copilot Settings

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, navigate to **Copilot**
2. Review and configure:
   - Data security and compliance controls
   - Plugin and extension permissions
   - Web data grounding settings (if applicable)

## Step 3: Grant Admin Consent (Alternative Methods)

If you haven't used the [Quick Start](#quick-start-for-admins-with-copilot-licenses) method, here are alternative ways to grant admin consent.

### 3.1 Grant Consent via Microsoft Entra Admin Center

#### Option A: Grant Consent After User Sign-in Attempt

When a user first tries to use Work IQ:

1. They will see a consent prompt indicating admin approval is required
2. The application will automatically be registered in your tenant
3. Follow these steps to grant consent:
   - Go to **Microsoft Entra admin center** at https://entra.microsoft.com
   - Navigate to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**
   - Find the **Work IQ CLI** application in the list
   - Select **Permissions** under **Security**
   - Review all requested permissions
   - Click **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]**
   - Click **Accept**

#### Option B: Pre-authorize via Admin Consent Request (If Configured)

If your tenant has admin consent workflow enabled:

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft Entra admin center** at https://entra.microsoft.com
2. Navigate to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Admin consent requests**
3. Look for pending requests related to Work IQ
4. Review the requested permissions
5. Click **Review permissions and consent**
6. Click **Accept** to grant tenant-wide consent

### 3.2 Grant Consent via PowerShell

For administrators who prefer scripted deployment.

**Prerequisites:** Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK if not already installed:

```powershell
# Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell module (run as Administrator)
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser

# Or update if already installed
Update-Module Microsoft.Graph
```

**Grant admin consent:**

```powershell
# Connect to Microsoft Graph with required scopes
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Application.ReadWrite.All", "DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All"

# Get the Work IQ service principal (after a user has attempted sign-in)
$workIqApp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq 'Work IQ CLI'"

# Get Microsoft Graph service principal
$graphSp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq 'Microsoft Graph'"

# Define the required permissions scope
$requiredScopes = "Sites.Read.All Mail.Read People.Read.All OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All Chat.Read ChannelMessage.Read.All ExternalItem.Read.All"

# Create the permission grant
$params = @{
    ClientId = $workIqApp.Id
    ConsentType = "AllPrincipals"
    ResourceId = $graphSp.Id
    Scope = $requiredScopes
}

New-MgOauth2PermissionGrant -BodyParameter $params

# Verify the grant was successful
Get-MgOauth2PermissionGrant -Filter "clientId eq '$($workIqApp.Id)'"
```

## Step 4: Configure User Access

### 4.1 Verify Application Access

After granting admin consent:

1. Go to **Microsoft Entra admin center** > **Enterprise applications**
2. Find and select the Work IQ CLI application
3. Go to **Users and groups**
4. By default, all users with Copilot licenses can access the application

### 4.2 Restrict Access (Optional)

If you want to limit which users can use Work IQ:

1. In the Work IQ CLI enterprise application, go to **Properties**
2. Set **Assignment required?** to **Yes**
3. Go to **Users and groups**
4. Click **+ Add user/group**
5. Select the users or groups that should have access
6. Click **Assign**

### 4.3 Configure Conditional Access (Recommended)

For additional security, create a Conditional Access policy:

1. Go to **Microsoft Entra admin center** > **Protection** > **Conditional Access**
2. Create a new policy
3. Configure:
   - **Users:** All users or specific groups
   - **Target resources:** Select Work IQ application
   - **Conditions:** Configure as needed (location, device, etc.)
   - **Grant:** Require MFA, compliant device, or other controls

## Security Considerations

### Data Access

Work IQ provides access to sensitive organizational data including:
- Email content
- Meeting transcripts
- Teams messages
- SharePoint/OneDrive documents

### Recommendations

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Only enable Work IQ for users who need it
   - Use assignment-required settings to control access

2. **Monitor Usage**
   - Review audit logs for Work IQ activity
   - Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps for additional monitoring

3. **Data Loss Prevention**
   - Ensure DLP policies are in place
   - Configure sensitivity labels for classified content

4. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically audit who has access to Work IQ
   - Review consent grants in Enterprise applications

### Compliance Notes

- Work IQ respects your organization's access controls during conversations
- Data accessed through Work IQ is subject to your existing compliance policies
