# M365 JSON Agent Developer Examples

This document provides workflow examples for common M365 Copilot JSON-based agent development scenarios.

> **Note:** This guide is for JSON-based agents that use `.json` manifest files directly.

---

## Example 1: Validate JSON Manifest

Validate manifest files using the ATK CLI:

```bash
# Validate manifest with ATK CLI (the ONLY supported validation method)
atk validate --env local
```

**Use case:** Local validation of manifest schema and required fields before deployment.

---

## Example 2: Development and Provisioning

Complete workflow for provisioning a JSON-based agent to a development environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Provision agent to development environment (no compile step needed for JSON agents)
atk provision --env local
```

**Result:** Returns a test URL like `https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/?titleId=T_abc123xyz` to test the agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot.

**Use case:** Testing agent functionality in a live environment during development.

---

## Example 3: Provision and Share Agent

Workflow for provisioning and sharing an agent with your organization:

```bash
# Provision agent to target environment
atk provision --env dev

# Share agent with tenant users
atk share --scope tenant --env dev
```

**Result:** Agent becomes available to all users in the Microsoft 365 tenant.

**Use case:** Deploying a shared agent for organizational use after testing and validation.

---

## Example 4: Package Agent for Distribution

Workflow for creating an agent package for distribution:

```bash
# Package agent for distribution
atk package --env prod
```

**Result:** Creates a distributable package file that can be uploaded to the Microsoft 365 admin center or shared externally.

**Use case:** Creating a final package for production deployment or external distribution.

## Example 5: Basic Declarative Agent JSON

A minimal declarative agent manifest file (`declarativeAgent.json`):

```json
{
  "version": "v1.6",
  "name": "My Support Agent",
  "description": "An agent to help with customer support inquiries",
  "instructions": "You are a helpful customer support agent. Help users find information about their issues and guide them to solutions. Be polite and professional at all times."
}
```

## Example 6: Agent with Capabilities

A declarative agent with SharePoint and Email capabilities:

```json
{
  "version": "v1.6",
  "name": "Knowledge Base Agent",
  "description": "An agent that searches company knowledge bases and emails",
  "instructions": "You help employees find information from our SharePoint knowledge base and relevant emails. Always cite your sources when providing information.",
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "OneDriveAndSharePoint",
      "items_by_url": [

        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Email"
    }
  ]
}
```

      "title": "Expense Reports",
      "text": "How do I submit an expense report?"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example 8: Agent with API Plugin Action

  "name": "Repairs Agent",
  "description": "An agent that helps manage repair tickets",
