# Microsoft Work IQ — Plugin Marketplace

> The official Microsoft Work IQ plugin collection for GitHub Copilot ✨

Extend the power of GitHub Copilot with Work IQ plugins — MCP servers, skills, and tools that connect AI assistants to your Microsoft 365 data.

> ⚠️ **Public Preview:** Features and APIs may change.

To access Microsoft 365 tenant data, the WorkIQ CLI and MCP Server need to be consented to permissions that require administrative rights on the tenant. On first access, a consent dialog appears. If you are not an administrator, contact your tenant administrator to grant access.

**For Tenant Administrators:** See the [Tenant Administrator Enablement Guide](./ADMIN-INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed instructions on granting admin consent, including a quick one-click consent URL.

For more information, see Microsoft's [User and Admin Consent Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/user-admin-consent-overview).

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have **Node.js** (which includes NPM and NPX) installed:

- **Node.js 18+** — [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

You can verify your installation by running:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

> 💡 **Why Node.js?** WorkIQ uses NPX to run the MCP server. NPX is included automatically with NPM, which comes bundled with Node.js.

## 📦 Alternative: Standalone MCP Installation

[![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=workiq&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40microsoft%2Fworkiq%22%2C%22mcp%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)

If you prefer to run WorkIQ as a standalone MCP server:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @microsoft/workiq

# Run the MCP server
workiq mcp
```

Or use npx without installing:

```bash
npx -y @microsoft/workiq mcp
```

Or add it as an MCP server in your coding agent or IDE:

```json
{
  "workiq": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@microsoft/workiq@latest", "mcp"],
    "tools": ["*"]
  }
}
```

> Note: please refer to [use MCP servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers) for the configuration instructions relative to Visual Studio Code.
